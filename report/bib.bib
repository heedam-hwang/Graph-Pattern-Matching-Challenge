  abstract = {Subgraph isomorphism (or subgraph matching) is one of the fundamental problems in graph analysis. It is an NP-hard problem, and extensive research has been done to develop practical solutions for subgraph isomorphism. Although a great deal of progress has been made, the existing solutions still show a limited scalability in handling large real graphs. The state-of-the-art algorithms are based on the general framework of backtracking which recursively finds all embeddings of a query graph in a data graph. In this thesis we introduce three new techniques: dynamic programming on directed acyclic graphs, the adaptive matching order with DAG-ordering, and pruning by failing sets, which together lead to a much faster and more scalable algorithm DP-iso for subgraph isomorphism. Extensive experiments with real datasets show that DP-iso outperforms the fastest existing solution by up to 4 orders of magnitude with respect to the running time and up to 6 orders of magnitude with respect to the number of recursions.},
